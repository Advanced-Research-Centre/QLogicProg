# Dependencies:
    # Make pypi for pip install
    # Based on SymPy

# Backend:
    # Define linear logic deductions as proof trees (a.k.a. causal graphs, DAGs)
    # Each axioms have probabilities 
    # Each edge can have probabilities, Bayesian networks (? needed)

# Feature: 
    # Novelty search of proof trees 
    # Induction of proof tree for given examples via evolution
    # Backward resolution of proofs and comparison of valid axioms
    # Refine natural language requirement to linear logic
    # Refine classical intutionist logic to linear logic
    # Refine paraconsistent logic to linear logic
    # Define proof tree
    # Refine linear logic to quantum circuit
